## Overview

**Stock Quote Alert** is a small console application written in **C# / .NET 9** that continuously polls Yahoo Finance for the latest quotation of a single ticker and sends an e-mail notification to a list of recipients when either of the following conditions becomes true:

1. The last traded price **exceeds** your _sell_ target â†’ *time to cash-out*  
2. The last traded price **drops below** your _buy_ target â†’ *time to buy more*

## Features

- âœ… Uses the [YahooFinanceApi](https://github.com/lppkarl/YahooFinanceApi) NuGet package for market data.
- âœ… Simple **SMTP** integration.
- âœ… Recipients managed via a plain **CSV** file â€“ easy to update without recompiling.
- âœ… Clean architecture with **dependency injection ready** services and interfaces.
- âœ… Fully unit-tested core business logic.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | 9.0 preview (or newer) |
| Internet access | Needed to reach Yahoo Finance & SMTP server |

> ðŸ’¡ You can check your SDK version with:
>
> ```bash
> dotnet --version
> ```

### Clone & Build

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/stock-quote-alert.git
cd stock-quote-alert

# restore dependencies & build
 dotnet build
```

### Configuration

Two small files in the repository root drive all runtime configuration.

#### `smtpsettings.json`

```json
{
  "Smtp": {
    "Host": "smtp.your-provider.com",
    "Port": 587,
    "EnableSsl": true,
    "Username": "your-smtp-user",
    "Password": "your-smtp-password",
    "From": "alerts@your-domain.com"
  }
}
```

#### `email_recipients.csv`

A minimal, header-based CSV with **name, e-mail** columns. Only the second column is currently used, so feel free to keep the first for notes.

```csv
Name,Email
Alice,alice@example.com
Bob,bob@example.com
```

Feel free to add as many recipients as you need â€“ one per line.

## Usage

The application is executed from the command line via `dotnet run` (or the produced DLL/EXE).  The syntax is:

```bash
dotnet run -- <TICKER> <SELL_PRICE> <BUY_PRICE>
```

Examples:

```bash
# Alert me when Petrobras (SÃ£o Paulo) is above 22.67 or below 22.59

dotnet run -- PETR4.SA 22.67 22.59

# US ticker â€“ Microsoft. Sell above 360, buy below 300

dotnet run -- MSFT 360 300
```

Once started, the program:

1. Reads SMTP & recipients configuration.
2. Polls Yahoo Finance every **10 minutes** (see `AlertIntervalMins` in `Program.cs`).
3. Sends an e-mail when either target is hit.
4. Sleeps and repeats indefinitely.

Stop the application with **Ctrl-C**.

## Project Layout

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ApiClients              # Connectivity to external quote providers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IStockQuoteClient.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ YahooStockQuoteClient.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ DataModels              # Plain-old C# objects used throughout
â”œâ”€â”€ Services                # Core business logic & abstractions

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SmtpEmailService.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ StockMonitorService.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Tests                   # xUnit test project
â””â”€â”€ Program.cs              # Console entry point
```

Key abstractions:

- `IStockQuoteClient` â†’ **YahooStockQuoteClient** implementation (easy to swap for another data feed).
- `IEmailService`     â†’ **SmtpEmailService** implementation.
- `IRecipientsService`â†’ **CsvRecipientsService** implementation.
- `IStockMonitorService` â†’ **StockMonitorService** orchestrates the decision.

## Running the Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Core behaviour (buy/sell alert detection) is covered with xUnit + Moq.

## Extending the Project

- **Different market data provider** â€“ implement `IStockQuoteClient` and register your class.
- **Alternative notification channel** â€“ implement `IEmailService` (e.g. push notifications, Slack webhook, SMSâ€¦).
- **Multiple tickers** â€“ loop over a list of tickers in `Program.cs` or refactor the monitoring service.
